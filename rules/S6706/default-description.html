<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cryptographic private key is a piece of sensitive information that is used in
asymmetric cryptography. They are used in conjunction with public keys to secure
communications and authenticate digital signatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Private keys can be used to achieve two main cryptographic operations,
encryption or digital signature. Those operations are the basis of multiple
higher-level security mechanisms such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>User authentication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servers authentication, for example in the X509 trust model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E-mail encryption</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Disclosing a cryptographic private key to an unintended audience can have severe
security consequences. The exact impact will vary depending on the role of the
key and the assets it protects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if the key is used in conjunction with an X509 certificate to
authenticate a web server as part of TLS communications, attackers will be able
to impersonate that server. This leads to Man-In-The-Middle-Attacks that would
affect both the confidentiality and integrity of the communications from clients
to that server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the key was used as part of e-mail protocols, attackers might be able to send
e-mails on behalf of the key owner or decrypt previously encrypted emails. This
might lead to sensitive information disclosure and reputation loss.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, if the key is used as part of a larger trust model (X509, PGP,
etc), it is necessary to issue and publish a revocation certificate. Doing so
will ensure that all people and assets that rely on this key for security
operations are aware of its compromise and stop trusting it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
