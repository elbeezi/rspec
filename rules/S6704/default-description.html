<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Riot API keys are used to access the Riot Games API, which provides developers
with programmatic access to various data and services related to Riot Games'
products, such as League of Legends. These API keys are used to authenticate and
authorize requests made to the API, allowing developers to retrieve game data,
player statistics, match history, and other related information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a Riot API key is leaked to an unintended audience, it can have significant
consequences. One of the main risks is unauthorized access. The unintended
audience may exploit the leaked API key to gain entry to the Riot Games API.
This can result in the unauthorized retrieval of sensitive data and misuse of
services provided by the API. It poses a serious security threat as it
allows individuals to access information that they should not have access to,
potentially compromising the privacy and integrity of the data.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
