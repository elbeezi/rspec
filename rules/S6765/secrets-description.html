<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>

<p>If an attacker gains access to a Figma personal access token, they might be able to compromise the data that is accessible to the linked Figma account. By doing so, it might be possible for confidential data to be leaked by the attacker.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker
exploiting the secret.</p>

<h4 id="_breach_of_trust_in_non_repudiation_and_disruption_of_the_audit_trail">Breach of trust in non-repudiation and disruption of the audit trail</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When such a secret is compromised, malicious actors might have the possibility
to send malicious event objects, causing discrepancies in the audit trail. This
can make it difficult to trace and verify the sequence of events, impacting the
ability to investigate and identify unauthorized or fraudulent activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All in all, this can lead to problems in proving the validity of transactions
or actions performed, potentially leading to disputes and legal complications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since this secret is used to process transaction-related operations, financial
loss may also occur if transaction-related objects are corrupted or the account
is tampered with.<br>
This can range from indirect losses to direct unauthorized transfers of funds
that can lead to bankruptcy or impoverishment of individuals.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
