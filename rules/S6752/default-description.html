<h2 id="_description">Description</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is
stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source code is
intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code
repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get exposed to an
unintended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_is_this_an_issue">Why is this an issue?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a
source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don&#8217;t need to know the secret might get access to it. They
might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated services or
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people&#8217;s role and
entitlement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_the_potential_impact">What is the potential impact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequences vary greatly depending on the situation and the secret-exposed
audience. Still, two main scenarios should be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since this secret is used to process transaction-related operations, financial
loss may also occur if transaction-related objects are corrupted or the account
is tampered with.<br>
This can range from indirect losses to direct unauthorized transfers of funds
that can lead to bankruptcy or impoverishment of individuals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_disclosure_of_blockchain_data">Disclosure of blockchain data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leaked key can be used to query APIs of blockchain services and access
sensitive information stored in the service metadata. This may include user
identities and other sensitive data.<br>
Such disclosure compromises user privacy and confidentiality.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_chaining_of_vulnerabilities">Chaining of vulnerabilities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Triggering arbitrary workflows can lead to problems ranging from a denial of
service to worse, depending on how the webhook&#8217;s data is handled. If the
webhook performs a specific action that is affected by a vulnerability, the
webhook acts as a remote attack vector on the enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Components affected by this webhook could, for example, experience unexpected
failures or excessive resource consumption. If it is a single point of failure
(SPOF), this leak is critical.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_data">Compromise of sensitive data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the affected service is used to store or process personally identifiable
information or other sensitive data, attackers knowing an authentication secret
could be able to access it. Depending on the type of data that is compromised,
it could lead to privacy violations, identity theft, financial loss, or other
negative outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, a company suffering a sensitive data compromise will face a
reputational loss when the security issue is publicly disclosed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_financial_loss_2">Financial loss</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid
third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of
client applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be
able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own need,
including in a way that was not expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service
provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this
additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected application.
This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application&#8217;s
users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_malware_distribution">Malware distribution</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, malware can be stored and distributed, both to users of the
service and other potential targets.<br>
It is important to note that this leak can lead to full system compromises in
the worst-case scenario.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_breach_of_trust_in_non_repudiation_and_disruption_of_the_audit_trail">Breach of trust in non-repudiation and disruption of the audit trail</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When such a secret is compromised, malicious actors might have the possibility
to send malicious event objects, causing discrepancies in the audit trail. This
can make it difficult to trace and verify the sequence of events, impacting the
ability to investigate and identify unauthorized or fraudulent activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All in all, this can lead to problems in proving the validity of transactions
or actions performed, potentially leading to disputes and legal complications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compromise_of_sensitive_personal_data">Compromise of sensitive personal data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of service is often used to exchange information that could include
personal information, chat logs, and other private data that users have shared
on the platform. This is called
<a href="https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/"><code>Personally Identifiable Information</code></a>.<br>
The leaked app key could provide a gateway for unauthorized individuals to
access and misuse this data, compromising the privacy and safety of the
application users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many industries and locations, there are legal and compliance requirements
to protect sensitive data. If this kind of sensitive personal data gets leaked,
companies face legal consequences, penalties, or violations of privacy laws.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_phishing_and_spam">Phishing and spam</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attacker can use this {secret_type} to spam users or lure them into links to
a malicious domain controlled by the attacker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spam can cause users to be exposed to the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unsolicited, inappropriate content, such as pornographic material</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fraudulent attempts to trick users into sending information or money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abusive or hateful statements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>False advertising or fraudulent claims</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a user has been phished on a legitimate-seeming third-party website, an
attacker can collect the user’s credentials, bypass multi-factor authentication
(MFA), and take over the user’s account on the trusted website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_applications_security_downgrade">Application&#8217;s security downgrade</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A downgrade can happen when the disclosed secret is used to protect
security-sensitive assets or features of the application. Depending on the
affected asset or feature, the practical impact can range from a sensitive
information leak to a complete takeover of the application, its hosting server
or another linked component.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an application that would disclose a secret used to sign user
authentication tokens would be at risk of user identity impersonation. An
attacker accessing the leaked secret could sign session tokens for arbitrary
users and take over their privileges and entitlements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_account_termination">Account termination</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unauthorized access to mailing service API keys can also result in resource
abuse. Attackers can exploit the API keys to send a large volume of spam emails
or perform other resource-intensive operations, causing a significant strain on
the mailing service provider&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service provider, being vigilant about such activities, may flag your
account and take action against it. This could lead to the suspension or
termination of the compromised account, thus causing significant inconvenience
and potential loss of communication with your customers or partners.</p>

<h2 id="_how_to_fix_it">How to fix it</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is
using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the secret is
revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or
malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will allow
determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what
extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This
will ensure the secret&#8217;s security and prevent any further unexpected disclosure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple
solutions are currently available.</p>
